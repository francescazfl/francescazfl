 I am a Bioengineering Ph.D. student at Caltech, currently focusing on the development and evaluation of machine learning-assisted protein engineering tools, co-advised by Frances Arnold and Yisong Yue. Additionally, I have collbaorated with Kevin K. Yang, Alex X. Lu, and Ava P. Amini during my summer internship at Microsoft Research New England. I am also passionate about making impactful computational tools accessible to wet-lab scientists and engineers.
