 I am a Bioengineering Ph.D. student at Caltech currently focusing on the development and evaluation of machine learning-assisted protein engineering tools, co-advised by Frances Arnold and Yisong Yue.

 Featured projects:
 -  Evaluation of Machine Learning-Assisted Directed Evolution Across Diverse Combinatorial Landscapes ([code](https://github.com/fhalab/SSMuLA), [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.24.619774v1))
 -  Feature Reuse and Scaling: Understanding Transfer Learning with Protein Language Models ([code](https://github.com/microsoft/protein-transfer), [paper](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/li24a.html))
